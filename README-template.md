## Overview

This is one of the easier challenges in the Frontend Mentor lineup. However, I took the challenge with the goal of improving my skills on predicting total time on a project. In this case, I predicted that I could have the project completed (not including this README file) in aproximately 3 hours, including making the design precise to the model (minus the pricing in the center toward the bottom because I could not bring myself to making it look offcenter like the model - yuck!). The actual time was at 3:15. So the original estimate was pretty good.

In a real life scenario, I likely woul dnot have had to spend so much time making everything so exact to the model. This would have saved me about an hour. 

I general, the project was easy and mostly a lot of nested sections and divs. I lost about 20 minutes wondering how to clip a background with an SVG file until I realized that I didn't need to do that. Oh well, that's the reason we do these projects.

### The challenge

According the Frontend Mentor, users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Create breakpoint for mobile

Additional Challenges I took on:

- Predict time the project would take
- Try and finish this project as quickly and exactly as possible

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was used primarily as a timed test: to see how long it would take to do a simple project and whether I could predict how long it would take.

### Continued development

Though I felt comfortable doing this project quickly (though just a tad more sloppy than my other projects), I want to see if I could predict some other more complex projects. Moreover, I would like to hit harder challenges to build my skills as quickly as possible.

As the challenges get more difficult, I would like to incorporate more Backend skills into my projects including the manipulation of databases, APIs, etc.
